# MiddleClick experiments

Experiments for the MiddleClick paper (see https://www.tombarbette.be/middleclick/).

This needs NPF to manage experiments (see https://github.com/tbarbette/npf). NPF will automatically download and build the dataplane, MiddleClick that is now fully merged to [FastClick](https://fastclick.dev]).

Then, one needs one client machine, one server machine, and the DUT that will run the various middlebox configurations.

Once set up, look at middleclick.sh to see commands to generate each graphs.
